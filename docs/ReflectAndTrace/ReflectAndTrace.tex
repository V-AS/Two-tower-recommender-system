This document encapsulates the development process of \progname, including changes made based on feedback from Dr. Smith and Yuanqi, the challenges I faced while implementing the project, how I addressed them, and what I learned from the experience.
\section{Changes in Response to Feedback}

This project has two reviewers: the course instructor, Dr. Smith, and a peer reviewer, Yuanqi. Every piece of feedback and the corresponding response has been tracked in \href{https://github.com/V-AS/Two-tower-recommender-system/issues}{GitHub issues}. 

I have retrieved Dr. Smith's feedback from the annotated PDF and created GitHub issues based on it, grouping similar comments into a single issue where appropriate.

The following list summarizes the feedback and the changes made. The issue link provides more detailed feedback, and the commit link allows viewing the exact changes made based on the feedback.

Some of the commits listed below are intermediate steps. I may have modified their content in the final Revision 1 documentation.

    The dot product is the only vector operation, which I am using to compute the estimated rating for an item-user pair. Since I am using PyTorch for model training, PyTorch handles all the calculations during the training process.

\subsection{VnV Plan and Report}
Feedbacks from Dr. Smith

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \href{https://github.com/V-AS/Two-tower-recommender-system/issues/15}{Issue 15}: Typos and formatting issues
    
    \href{https://github.com/V-AS/Two-tower-recommender-system/commit/387fdd7ecc6dce5318262a72c5775bf88147ec08}{Commit 387fdd7} Fixed typos and formatting issues. Added hyperlinks for documents and specified which tests will be automated.  

    \item \href{https://github.com/V-AS/Two-tower-recommender-system/issues/16}{Issue 16}: Be specific about the system tests for functional requirements. Some tests may be challenging to implement. Section 3.7, Software Validation Plan, is incorrectâ€”it is not a validation plan but a verification exercise.
 
    \href{https://github.com/V-AS/Two-tower-recommender-system/commit/b5f0d11daf4a2c852395552be9d2ef751c515a0f}{Commit b5f0d11}, \href{https://github.com/V-AS/Two-tower-recommender-system/commit/4ef7829f9839398cdde3757c859d094fa82e90cb#diff-8d3e9ddbf3d26cf5e2a7027bf962071598c6f3916127fdabcb800f03d22ba969}{Commit 4ef7829}, \href{https://github.com/V-AS/Two-tower-recommender-system/commit/ad87f5a9632ae4926f5eedf60d9299e422eebe47}{Commit ad87f5a}: Rewrote Sections 4.1 and 4.2 to make each test explicitly define the input and output. Also simplified the system tests. Rewrote section 3.7.

    After these changes, while implementing the project, I found that some tests were still challenging to implement. As a result, I rewrote a significant portion of the VnV Plan. \href{https://github.com/V-AS/Two-tower-recommender-system/commit/4ef7829f9839398cdde3757c859d094fa82e90cb#diff-8d3e9ddbf3d26cf5e2a7027bf962071598c6f3916127fdabcb800f03d22ba969}{Commit 4ef7829} 
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{I haven't received the VnV Plan feedback from Yuanqi.}
\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\subsection{Challenge Level}
This is a non-research project.

\subsection{Extras}

The extra component of the project is a \href{https://github.com/V-AS/Two-tower-recommender-system/blob/main/docs/Extras/UserManual/UserManual.pdf}{user guide}.

\section{Design Iteration (LO11 (PrototypeIterate))}

When designing the first version, I attempted to incorporate too many features without having comprehensive experience in project development, particularly in system and unit testing, which made the project unfeasible. The most significant difference between the initial design and the final implementation was that the system and unit tests were redesigned to be simpler and more straightforward to implement.

Since I am following a widely used structure of a recommendation system, there is not a significant difference in the overall structure of different modules.

In my initial design, I failed to recognize that developers and users are distinct stakeholders with different needs. Users require a simple, intuitive interface for interaction, while developers need control over system parameters such as the number of layers in a deep neural network or the number of training epochs. In the final version, I incorporated a user interface to facilitate easier project usage.

\section{Design Decisions (LO12)}

A major limitation encountered during implementation was the poor quality of available datasets. I could only find public datasets with very limited personal information, and many items had received ratings from only a single user. This posed a significant challenge as personal information is crucial for recommendation systems, especially when employing deep neural network approaches which demand high-quality data.

To address this issue, I devoted time to feature engineering, calculating additional features not present in the original dataset, such as frequency metrics. While this resulted in some improvement, the impact was minimal. Given the time constraints, I was unable to replace the deep neural network approach, as doing so would have necessitated restructuring the entire project. Instead, I modified the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) to adjust the quality and performance requirements for the recommendation system. Therefore, the performance of this project will not be measured.


\section{Reflection on Project Management (LO24)}


\subsection{What Went Well?} 
The Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions worked very well. I was really nervous about CI and GitHub Actions before I implemented the project. However, the automated unit tests and auto-training were easier than I expected. GitHub Actions has very easy-to-follow instructions and a lot of online resources.
\subsection{What Went Wrong?}
The performance and the quality of the recommended results were not good. This was primarily due to the dataset being limited and my choice of a deep learning approach which requires a good dataset.
\subsection{What Would you Do Differently Next Time?}
I would first find a dataset, and then decide the appropriate learning algorithm to use based on the dataset I have. I should not choose an algorithm then find a dataset. This is especially important for a project related to learning. I will not be able to get good results if the dataset is bad or if I am not using a suitable learning algorithm.
